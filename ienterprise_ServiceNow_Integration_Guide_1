## What This Is About

This guide walks you through connecting iEnterprise to your ServiceNow instance. The goal is simple: enable store teams to create and track support tickets from **Site Manager** without logging into ServiceNow directly.

We require a small set of details from your team. Once provided, we handle the rest.

- No custom development inside ServiceNow  
- No workflow changes  
- Clean, secure connection between systems  

**Typical setup time:** 3–5 business days after credentials and mappings are received.

## 1. Connection & Authentication

To establish secure communication with your ServiceNow instance, we need the following:

### Required Details

- **Instance Base URL**  
  Example: `https://yourcompany.service-now.com`

- **API Username**  
  Dedicated integration user account

- **API Password**  
  Password for the integration account

- **Required Roles**  
  - Incident create/read access  
  - Attachment access  

### Recommendation

Use a **non-human service account**, not a personal login. A dedicated API user aligned with enterprise security policies avoids disruptions caused by password changes or employee transitions.

---

## 2. API Access Requirements

The integration uses standard ServiceNow REST APIs only.

### Required Permissions

| Action              | Table           | Access Level |
|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Create incidents    | `incident`      | Create       |
| Read incidents      | `incident`      | Read         |
| Upload attachments  | `sys_attachment`| Create       |

No workflow updates. No scripting. Existing ServiceNow behavior remains unchanged.

---

## 3. Channel Configuration

### Required Change in ServiceNow

Add a new value to the **Channel** dropdown field:

| Field   | New Value     |
|--------|---------------|
| Channel| Site Manager  |

### Why This Matters

ServiceNow reporting relies heavily on ticket origin channels such as Phone, Email, or Portal.

Without a dedicated **Site Manager** channel:
- Tickets appear as generic API traffic
- Adoption metrics are lost
- ROI cannot be measured accurately

This is a **single dropdown value change**. It does not affect routing, automation, or workflows, but it preserves clean reporting and visibility.

---

## 4. Category & Subcategory Mapping

Each ServiceNow instance uses unique Category and Subcategory values. To ensure alignment:

### What We Need
- Exact Category and Subcategory values from your ServiceNow configuration

### Why It Matters
- Tickets created in iEnterprise align with IT classification standards
- No misclassified incidents
- No manual cleanup later

### Format
- Simple list or export from ServiceNow is sufficient

---

## 5. Ticket Status Mapping

Store teams expect real-time ticket status updates in Site Manager.

To support this, we map your ServiceNow statuses to iEnterprise states using **status names and internal integer IDs**.

### Example Mapping

| Status Name   | Internal Value (Integer ID) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| New          | (your value)                |
| In Progress  | (your value)                |
| On Hold      | (your value)                |
| Resolved     | (your value)                |
| Closed       | (your value)                |

Your instance may include additional or differently named states. Share all relevant values and we will handle the mapping.

## 6. Store / Location Field Mapping

Retail tickets must be tied to the correct physical store.

### What We Need

- **Store Number Field**  
  Which ServiceNow field contains the store or location identifier?

- **Field Type**  
  - Standard Location table reference, or  
  - Custom field  

This ensures accurate routing and consistent analytics across systems.

### Integration Flow

| Step | What We Do                    | What You’ll See                         |
|-----:|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1    | Configure integration         | Credentials and mappings applied        |
| 2    | Validate API connectivity     | Successful system communication         |
| 3    | Test ticket lifecycle         | Create, update, close test tickets      |
| 4    | Confirm production readiness  | Approval to go live                     |

### Timeline

**3–5 business days** from receipt of credentials and mappings. Most integrations complete in under one week.
